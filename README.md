# Predicting-Mortgage-Loan-Defaults
The goal of the project is to see if the data from Lending Club can be used to predict mortgage defaults.  

# Description
This project stemmed from the need to find potential data that could be a good predictor for insurance claims and/or payment defaults on homeowners insurance policies.  I mainly focused on how predictable the loan data is on mortgage defaults because I think this provides an ample base for the predictability of the data.  I used a supervised learning technique in R to analyze this data.
