# Predicting-Mortgage-Loan-Defaults
The goal of the project is to see if the data from Lending Club can be used to predict mortgage defaults.  

# Description


This information could potentially be very beneficial for insurance companies that sell homeowners insurance.  This data could not only be predictive of mortgage defaults but of future claims submissions or inability to pay homeowners insurance premium.  I plan on using a supervised learning technique in R to analyze the data.  The data comes from the Lending Club.
