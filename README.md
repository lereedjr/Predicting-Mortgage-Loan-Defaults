# Predicting-Mortgage-Loan-Defaults
The goal of the project is to see if the data from Lending Club can be used to predict mortgage defaults.  

# Description
This project stemmed from the need to find potential data that could be a good predictor for insurance claims and/or payment defaults on homeowners insurance policies.  I mainly focused on how predictable the loan data is on mortgage defaults because I think this provides an ample base for the predictability of the data.  I used a supervised learning technique in R to analyze this data.

# Data Observations
Some questions that stemmed from data exploration.
1. Is the mortgage data a good predictor of defaults?
2. Which variables are highly correlated with loan status?
3. Will credit information be a highly correlated variable? 

The original dataset had 150 variables and 1,646,801 observations.  The dataset consisted of observations pertaining to car loans, debt consolidation, educational, wedding, etc.

# Data Cleaning
The dataset was consolidated to only focus on mortgage loans (excluding those taken out for home improvement purposes).
